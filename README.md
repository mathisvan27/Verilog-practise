Practising SystemVerilog tasks using the HDLBits website, which contains a large curated list of Verilog tasks designed to teach and develop the fundamentals of SystemVerilog.

# An Introduction

I'm Looking to expand my Verilog ability so I am self teaching and pracitising SystemVerilog using the HDLBits website. This website contains a large, curated list of SystemVerilog tasks, each designed to work on a certain aspect of Verilog programming (such as combinational and sequential logic, FSM etc.). 

The aim of this repo is to showcase my journey towards learning SystemVerilog, talking about my code itself and any issues I came across.
