# Verilog-practise
Practising SystemVerilog tasks using the HDLBits website, which contains a large curated list of Verilog tasks designed to teach and develop the fundamentals of SystemVerilog.

# An Introduction
Hi. I'm Mathisvan (call me Mash). I'm a third year Electronic Engineer at the University of Warwick, looking to find myself in the silicon design industry. My desired role is to become a verification engineer as I like using SystemVerilog, which I believe is a great way to work on my shared passion of programming and electrical circuits.

I'm Looking to expand my Verilog ability so I am self teaching and pracitising SystemVerilog using the HDLBits website. This website contains a large, curated list of SystemVerilog tasks, each designed to work on a certain aspect of Verilog programming (such as combinational and sequential logic, FSM etc.). 

The aim of this repo is to showcase my journey towards learning SystemVerilog, talking about my code itself and any issues I came across.
